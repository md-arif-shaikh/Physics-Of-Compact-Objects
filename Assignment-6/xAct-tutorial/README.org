* Installation
The installation guide is here http://xact.es/download/install. Follow
the steps below.
  - Download the ~xact~ package from the homepage at
    http://xact.es/xTensor/.
  - Extract the compressed file ~tar -xzvf xAct_1.1.4.tgz~.
  - Place the extracted directory ~xAct~ inside the mathematica
    installation directory. Follow the below instructions.
  - In mathematica ~$UserBaseDirectory~ will give the directory where
    mathematica is installed for the user. There is a dir called
    ~Applications~. You have to place the ~xAct~ dir inside that
    directory.
  - ~mv xAct /home/<user>/.Mathematica/Applications/~.
  - Linux:
    - system-wide installation (requires root priviledges):
      ~/usr/share/Mathematica/Applications/~
    - single-user installation:
      ~$HOME/.Mathematica/Applications/~
  - Mac OS:
    - system-wide installation (requires root priviledges):
      ~/Library/Mathematica/Applications/~
    - single-user installation:
      ~/Users/<user>/Library/Mathematica/Applications/~
* Usage
** Package needed for the current tutorial
In the current tutorial we want to compute the components of the
Eienstein tensor in a particular basis. ~xTensor~ does not do this. For
this we need ~xCoba~ which performs component calculations. However,
~xCoba~ needs ~xTensor~ for it's internal calculations. So we need
these two packages which are bundled inside the ~xAct~ package. 
Once the installation is done, open a mathematica notebook and use
 - ~<<xAct`xTensor`~ to load the ~xTensor~ package.
 - ~<<xAct`xCoba`~ to load the ~xCoba~ package.
** Define a manifold
The first step is to define our manifold. We give a name for our
manifold, dimension of the manifold and a set of abstract indices for
the tensor on this manifold. The manifold is defined using the
function ~DefManifold~.
#+BEGIN_SRC wolfram
DefManifold[M4, 4, {α,β,γ,μ,ν,λ,σ,η}]
#+END_SRC
~M4~ is the manifold we are defining, ~4~ is the dimension of this
manifold and the greek symbols are abstract indices for the tensors on
this manifold.

** Define a metric on the manifold
Now that we have defined our manifold, we will now define a metric on
this manifold. We do this using the ~ DefMetric~ function.
#+BEGIN_SRC wolfram
DefMetric[-1, metric[-α, -β], CD, {";", "∇"}]
#+END_SRC
~-1~ is the sign of the determinant of the metric.

** Define a chart on the manifold
We want to work in a particular coordinate basis. We will work in the
spherical polar coordinate basis. For this we need to define our
chart. This is done using the function ~DefChart~
#+BEGIN_SRC wolfram
DefChart[cb, M4, {0, 1, 2, 3}, {t[], r[], θ[], φ[]}]
#+END_SRC

The arguments are the name for our chart ~cb~, the manifold ~M4~ on which
we are defining this chart, indices for the coordinate and
coordinates.

** Define scalar functions
We also need to define any scalar functions we will need later. For
the stationary spherically symmetric space time we need to define the
two scalar functions ~Λ~ and ~Φ~. We use the function
~DefScalarFunction~ to define these.
#+BEGIN_SRC wolfram
DefScalarFunction[Λ]
DefScalarFunction[Φ]
#+END_SRC
