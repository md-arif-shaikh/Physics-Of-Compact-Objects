* About
  This repo is for codes and resources for the course on *Physics of Compact Objects* taught by Prof Ajith at ICTS Jan-April 2021.
* References

* Programming Languages
The assignments are solved using
  - [[https://julialang.org/][julia]] in the form of [[https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl][Pluto]] notebooks. Insturctions for installing and running
    Pluto could be found in the github repo. For convenience of
    viewing, pdf versions of the
    notebooks are also uploaded. Links to the exported pdfs are given below.
  - [[https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/][Mathematica]] Notebooks.
  - [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] scripts and [[https://jupyter.org/][jupyter]] notebooks.
